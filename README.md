# Professional-README-Generator

## Description
Have you ever wanted to bypass the tedious process of creating a Readme? Though it’s one of the easier parts of the coding process, it can be least looked forward to because of how similar each readme we create is. 
Who wants to ty pe the same document over and over and over again, the only difference being small variations in content?
Well thanks to the Professional Readme Generator, you now have access to an application that will create the foundation for your next Readme!
All you have to do is input the specific information you want displayed in each section of your file and voila, you have a new README.md file created for the project of your choosing!

## Installation
In order to use this product correctly, complete the following steps:
1) Fork the repository.
2) Git clone the SSH key into a directory of your choosing (I recommend creating a new directory and copying over the folders from this repository. You can also just create your readme in this folder and then copy the finished readme file into the project repository the readme was created for).
3) Open Visual Studio Code. Be sure to open the terminal inside VSC as well (shortcut: control + `). In the terminal, navigate to the Develop folder.
4) While in the Develop folder in the terminal, run the code: npm install. This will install the inquirer node to your repository.
5) Once inquirer has finished installing, run the code: node index.js. This will present a series of questions in the terminal. Answer these questions in detail, as your answers will be sorted into various sections in a new document to create a unique Readme.



## Usage
After you have followed the installation steps to create your Readme, be sure to make edits to the generated file. For instance, in the License section of the file, there may be a space to input your name (‘INSERT NAME’) or the year the license was used (e.g. ‘INSERT YEAR’).

If you do not need a section, you can remove it from the physical document. For example, this particular Readme Does not need a Test section because there has not been a way to test this specific application. Though I will be leaving this section on the readme, I could also have manually removed this line from the readme file product, prior to pushing my newly created readme to Github.
Similarly, you can manually add sections to the readme that are not covered by this application to further customize your document.

Lastly, I encourage you to be as detailed as you would like when responding to the prompts in this application. Even if you only input a sentence for each prompt, you will still be presented with a fully functional readme. However, the more detail you input the first go around, the less work you will have to do when placing the finishing touches on your readme later on. This is a great tool, please take advantage of its usability.
